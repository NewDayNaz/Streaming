# ProWebStage-LowerThird
This is a fork of the amazing work done by https://github.com/L2N6H5B3/ProWebStage but my use case is adding a browser source to use as a transparent lower third overlay to easily bring lyrics into our livestream, you can tweak the ``transitionTime`` variable to adjust the fade in time between slides.

This isolates the data to just the Current Slide data type from ProPresenter's web stage display api.
